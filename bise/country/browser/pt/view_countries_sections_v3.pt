            <div class="content-wrapper">

              <p class="section-description">In an effort to minimize the reporting burden of EU Member States, the European Commission and Member States agreed that the Commission would extract relevant information from the 5th national reports to the Convention
                on Biological Diversity (CBD) of EU Member States, to report on progress to the EU 2020 biodiversity strategy.</p>

              <p>At the time of finalization of the synthesis of the 5th national reports (26th of August 2015), all but 5 Member States had submitted their reports to the CBD. Of these 5 countries, Greece, Malta, Portugal and Lithuania provided information for
                this synthesis prior to the finalization of their 5th national report.</p>

              <p>The 5th national reports were examined for information that could be used for the reporting on selected actions under Targets 1-6 of the EU biodiversity strategy. The relevant information was directly copied from the national reports, and is thus
                presented in its original language and wording.</p>

              <p>The information was collected per country and the focus is on information that is particular to the respective Member State rather than referencing EU wide information. In addition, only information that is not directly reported to the European
                Commission by member states was retrieved from the reports.</p>

              <p>According to the suggested structure for the 5th national reports from the CBD, part III of the reports shall outline the progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The analysis therefore focused on this part of the reports.</p>

              <p class="section-description">In 2013 the European Commission adopted a Green Infrastructure Strategy, 'to promote the deployment of green infrastructure in the EU in urban and rural areas'. This is a key step in implementing the EU 2020
                Biodiversity Strategy and specifically Target 2 that requires that 'by 2020, ecosystems and their services are maintained and enhanced by establishing green infrastructure and restoring at least 15% of degraded ecosystems'. Restoration action is also
                seen as a crucial response to climate change.</p>

              <p>The country pages in BISE on Green Infrastructure provide an overview on the activities on Green Infrastructure within the Member States. The information presented on these pages has been compiled by Ecologic Institute within the scope of the
                European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity (ETC-BD) and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the European Commission or European Environment Agency. The text has been aligned with the Environmental Implementation Review (EIR), which
                provides country-specific reports every two years focusing on essential topics in the area of environmental legislation such as green infrastructure. National experts have not yet appraised the information on the BISE GI country pages and will update
                and amend as necessary upon their review.
